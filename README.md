CS164 Final Project

I'm having a problem where the server has to send messages twice for clients to receive them. Even if the client is listening when the first message is sent. It's problematic because the amount of times I need to send the message is not consistent, and it's causing syncronisity issues with the rest of the menu logic

Logically my program is good, but I haven't been able to fully test it.
